The implementation of Paper "SPRNN: A Spatial-temporal Recurrent Neural Network for Crowd Flow Prediction"
Crowd flow predictionï¼šThe urban development inevitably invokes the overcrowded population, which brings not only challenges to the daily operation of cities, but also opportunities. On one hand, public resources, especially those related to public safety and public services, need to be properly arranged in advance to deal with the upcoming peak of crowd flows. On the other hand, it also brings business opportunities. For example, on-demand service providers, such as taxi and sharing-ride services (\eg, Uber) have motivations to provide customers with convenient and elastic services to fulfill the ever-increasing demands with considerable remunerations. The approach of crowd-flow prediction brings possibilities to address the above urban-traffic problems. Via analyzing the massive crowd-flow data, the traffic events, like traffic requirements and traffic congestion in near future, can be accurately identified by Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).
